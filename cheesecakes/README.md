## Bootstrap application data

When you start your application for the first time, if you don't have any data, we auto inject a dataset in your mongo database.
You can see how we did it in the `/config/function/bootstrap.js` file. It calls the `initDatabase` function of the `/api/app/service/App.js` service's file. The dataset is in `/api/app/config/data.json`.

## Rendering views

When you are at `http://localhost:1337`, Strapi renders the `/public/index.html` file. In this file we inject `/public/css/style.css` and `/public/scripts/index.js`.
When you click on a cheesecake item, Strapi renders `public/product.html`. Documentation link https://strapi.io/documentation/guides/public-assets.html.

## Filters

In the `/public/scripts/index.js` you will see how to make a GET request using filter params on cakes.
API endpoints are located at `/api/cake/config/routes.json`. Documentation link https://strapi.io/documentation/guides/filters.html.

## Custom route

To apply the logged user as the author of the review we have to custom the back-e,d part, we created a `/reviews/submit` route.
In the controller function we get the user id from the session and apply the value to the review object.

## Authentication

In `public/product.html` page we add login / register function to be able to submit a review. At the end of the `/public/scripts/product.js` file you will see how use auth routes. Documentation link https://strapi.io/documentation/guides/authentification.html.

## Admin

In the admin panel (`http://localhost:1337/admin`) you will be able to manage (create/update/delete) cakes.
